This program is used for capturing video from laptop's camera, detecting a red object (it can easily be configured for other colors) and communicate with a board(1) that controls 2 motors. The information told to the board is velocity and direction. This information is calculated based on where exactly the red object is. Those motors drive the laptop right to the specified object. 

Used libraries:
*OpenCV
*cvblob
